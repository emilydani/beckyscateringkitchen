        <p>
        These are real cheesecakes that are baked slowly, to create a smooth, rich texture that will leave you wanting more.  Honestly, you can compare these to The Cheesecake Factory!  I have made a variety of flavors, but I am always willing to try something new if you have other ideas in mind.  Each cheesecake serves 16 people.
