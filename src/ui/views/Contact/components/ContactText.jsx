                    These are real cheesecakes that are baked slowly, to create a smooth, rich texture that will leave you wanting more.  Honestly, you can compare these to The Cheesecake Factory!  I have made a variety of flavors, but I am always willing to try something new if you have other ideas in mind.  Each cheesecake serves 16 people.

                    To me, food means family and friends. I love bringing people together with delicious food; this is my ultimate passion! Whether it's a family dinner, a work party or a wedding, I hope you'll choose me to be apart of your next special event.  I guarantee wonderful food that is made just for you, from scratch, that will leave your guest talking about the food they were served.....in a positive way!
